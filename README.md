## How to Make It Smarter

Add more training examples to the `reviews` list:

```python
reviews = [
    "amazing great love",           # Positive
    "excellent best perfect",       # Positive
    "fantastic awesome wonderful",  # Positive
    "terrible awful bad",           # Negative
    "horrible worst hate",          # Negative
    "disappointing poor useless"    # Negative
]
```

**Rule:** Add equal numbers of positive and negative reviews!

Update the `labels` list to match:
```python
labels = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  # 1=Positive, 0=Negative
```
